# Abbey Park High School Programming Club

Welcome to Programming Club! Below is some basic information about programming and details on how to use this repository.

What is Programming?

Programming, in its simplest sense is writing ‘code’ that tells a computer what to do. However, programming is a lot more than just that. Programming includes logic, analysis, and the ability to solve problems.

What will you learn?

At Programming Club, we will teach you the fundamental concepts that you need in order to program effectively. If you choose to, you can then either learn how to create computer applications or prepare for the Canadian Computing Contest, held in February every year.

What is the Canadian Computing Contest?

The Canadian Computing Contest is an annual computer programming contest held in February by the University of Waterloo’s Center for Education in Mathematics and Computing. Details about this contest can be accessed on the following webpage: http://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing.html

So how does programming work?

When you want to tell a computer how to do something, you can’t say it in English-computers can’t understand it. Instead, you write the instructions in a programming language. There are a multitude of programming languages, all with different features and use cases. For the purposes of this club, we’ll be using C++, one of the most ubiquitous languages around.

How do I use this page?

For all the lessons we teach at programming club, examples of the code are available here. Simple navigate through the folders at the top of this page to find the code you want.
