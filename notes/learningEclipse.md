# Eclipse and IDEs

### Written by Aaditya Chaudhary

Programmers use Integrated Development Environments (or IDEs for short). They are essentially text editors that we can use to write, compile, and run code.

We use Eclipse as our IDE, mainly because of it's simplicity and it's popularity.

### A Few Definitions

Compile: we use a *compiler* to convert the code we write as text to *bytecode*. 

Bytecode: bytecode is the type of file that the computer can use to run the code.

## The key features of Eclipse include:

- The navigator: The panel on the left is the navigator. It allows you to open different files in order to view and modify them.

- The text editor: This is the panel in the center, which allows you to actually view and edit the files you open in the navigator. This is the main feature, and the one you will be using most often in eclipse.

- the console: The console is the one of the tabs on the bottom panels. It doesn't appear by default, however. As soon as you run Java code that has an output, it will appear. The console window is the output window. If for example, your program outputs the sentence "Hello World!", the console is where it will show up.

- The Run Button: This small green button on the top of the screen is what we use to run our java programs. You can also right click on any java program in the navigator and select "run as java program" to run it.

## Let's get started!

1. To begin, we open up Eclipse by clicking on it's icon on the desktop.
2. A window will open asking what "directory" you'd like to use. Make sure to use a folder on your G drive (that way you can access your files on any school computer)
3. Eclipse will open with a welcome window. You can go ahead and delete it. Eclipse will then open with the actual IDE.
4. You can right click on the navigator and click 'new', then 'Java Project'. A smaller window will open up and you can enter the name of your project in.
5. Next, we're going to click on our project and create a new 'class.' Make sure to check the exact same boxes as we did.then double click on the class to open it in the editor.
6. Now we're ready to write our first java program!
