# Math With Code

#### Made By Yash Trvedi

With java we are able to math using all the standard math operators
## Math Operators
Java has access to all of the basic math operators. These include:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
---
##### Addition
With addition you can add values, and/or variables. 
Ex:
````java
int i = 5;
int a = 2;
int b = i + a;
````
##### +=
Since we often add a value to an existing variable java has a built in += which basically means integer = integer + (value)
ex.
````java
int = 5;
i = i + 2
// i now equals 7

int i = 5;
i += 2;
//i now equals 7
````
---
##### Subtraction
With subtract you can subtract values, and/or variables. 
Ex:
````java
int i = 5;
int a = 2;
int b = i - a;
````
##### -=
Since we often subtract a value to an existing variable java has a built in -= which basically means integer = integer - (value)
ex.
````java
int = 5;
i = i - 2
// i now equals 3

int i = 5;
i -= 2;
//i now equals 3
````
##### Multiplication
With multiplication you can multiply values, and/or variables. 
Ex:
````java
int i = 5;
int a = 2;
int b = i * a;
````
##### *=
Since we often multiply a value into an existing variable java has a built in *= which basically means integer = integer * (value)
ex.
````java
int = 5;
i = i * 2
// i now equals 10

int i = 5;
i *= 2;
//i now equals 10
````
##### Division
With division you can devide values, and/or variables. 
Ex:
````java
int i = 5;
int a = 2;
int b = i / a;
````
##### /=
Since we often devide a value into an existing variable java has a built in /= which basically means integer = integer / (value)
ex.
````java
int = 6;
i = i / 2
// i now equals 3

int i = 6;
i / 2;
//i now equals 3
````
##### Remainder/Mondulo
We can also find the remainder of devision operations. This is also call this a mondulo
Ex:
````java
int i = 5;
int a = 2;
int b = i % a;
int b = 1;
````
